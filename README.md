# SymMC-Tool

### 1. Overview

- SymMC is an automated tool implemented to solve three Alloy related problems:  

  - SymMC is the first approach that automatically approximates non-isomorphic model enumeration/counting for Alloy specifications. 

  - Thanks to the non-isomorphic model counting, SymMC also provides the first automatic quantification measurement on the solution space pruning ability of Kodkod PaSB. 

  - SymMC provides a competitive isomorphic counting approach for Alloy specifications compared to the state-of-the-art model counters.

    

- SymMC is built upon MiniSat, which is a classic CDCL SAT solver, to do
